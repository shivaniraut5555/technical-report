            "THE MOON" with the history of the early solar system etched on it beckons 
            mankind from time immemorial to admire its marvels and discover its secrets. 
            Understanding the moon provides a pathway to unravel the early 
            evolution of the solar system and that of the planet earth.

            Through the ages, the Moon, our closest celestial body has aroused curiosity 
            in our mind much more than any other objects in the sky. This led to 
            scientific study of the Moon, driven by human desire and quest for 
            knowledge. This is also reflected in the ancient verse

            Chandrayaan-1 was the first Indian lunar probe under Chandrayaan program. 
            It was launched by the Indian Space Research Organisation in October 2008, 
            and operated until August 2009. The mission included a lunar orbiter and an 
            impactor. India launched the spacecraft using a PSLV-XL rocket on 22 October 
            2008 at 00:52 UTC from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, at Sriharikota, Andhra 
            Pradesh. The mission was a major boost to India's space program, as India 
            researched and developed its own technology in order to explore the Moon 
            The vehicle was inserted into lunar orbit on 8 November 2008.

            Chandrayaan spacecraft was a cube of side 1.5 m and was based on the I-1-K 
            bus which was used in the IRS series of satellites. It also carried 
            the Moon Impact Probe which landed on the moon on November 14, 2009.

        <p class="paras">
            Chandrayaan's NASA Instrument Moon Mineralogy Mapper has confirmed the magma ocean hypothesis, meaning that the Moon was once completely molten. In its 10-month orbit around the Moon, Chandrayaan-1's X-ray Spectrometer (C1XS) detected titanium, confirmed the presence of calcium, and gathered the most accurate measurements yet of magnesium, aluminium and iron on the lunar surface.

                On 18 November 2008, the Moon Impact Probe was released from Chandrayaan-1 at a height of 100 km (62 mi). During its 25-minute descent, Chandra's Altitudinal Composition Explorer (CHACE) recorded evidence of water in 650 mass spectra readings gathered during this time. On 24 September 2009 Science journal reported that the Nasa Instrument Moon Mineralogy Mapper (M3) on Chandrayaan-1 had detected water ice on the Moon. But, on 25 September 2009, ISRO announced that the MIP, another instrument on board Chandrayaan-1, had discovered water on the Moon just before impact and had discovered it 3 months before NASA's M3.The announcement of this discovery was not made until NASA confirmed it.

            <li class="list-heads">Lunar water production</li>
            <p class="paras">
                According to European Space Agency (ESA) scientists, the lunar regolith (a loose collection of irregular dust grains making up the Moon's surface) absorbs hydrogen nuclei from solar winds. Interaction between the hydrogen nuclei and oxygen present in the dust grains is expected to produce hydroxyl (HO-) and water (H2O).

            <li class="list-heads">Lunar Caves</li>
                <p class="paras">
                    Chandrayaan-1 imaged a lunar rille, formed by an ancient lunar lava flow, with an uncollapsed segment indicating the presence of a lunar lava tube, a type of large cave below the lunar surface. The tunnel, which was discovered near the lunar equator, is an empty volcanic tube, measuring about 2 km (1.2 mi) in length and 360 m (1,180 ft) in width.

            <li class="list-heads">Tectonism</li>
            <p class="paras">
                Data from the microwave sensor (Mini-SAR) of Chandrayaan-1 processed using the image analysis software ENVI, has revealed a good amount of past tectonic activity on the lunar surface. The researchers think that the faults and fractures discovered could be features of past interior tectonic activity coupled with meteorite impacts.

        <p class="headings">CHANDRAYAAN-1 VS CHANDRAYAAN-2: INSTRUMENTS ONBOARD</p>
        <p class="paras">
            There were 11 scientific instruments onboard the Chandrayaan-1 spacecraft. Five of them were Indian while the others were from European Space Agency (ESA), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) and Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.
Chandrayaan-2's orbiter carries eight scientific payloads for mapping the lunar surface and to study the exosphere (outer atmosphere) of the Moon. The lander carries three scientific payloads to conduct surface and subsurface science experiments.
